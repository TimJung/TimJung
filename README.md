# Welcome Earthling 🌍, alien 👽, or inter-dimensional entity 🧙

You have arrived at my github. Every moment in your life has brought you here to this time & place. Truly tragic. You had so much potential.

## About me

🛸 The being known as Tim: Senior Software Engineer & coffee receptacle working @ Riot Games on League of Legends: Wild Rift. Formerly @ Activision Blizzard on the Call of Duty Companion App. Currently, I focus on C, Unity, C#, and cool problems like matchmaking. I used to focus on JavaScript & React Native.

🏭 Life recap: Detroit-born. Discovered the StarCraft & Age of Empires map editors as a kid. Addicted to making games for my friends. Teenage addiction to World of Warcraft & The Orange Box. Learned Java from a great mentor from the island of Java. Degree in Computer Science. Worked at Activision Blizzard (a huge dream!). Joined the dark side at Riot Games (another huge dream!). Wrote a personal github readme - this one - you're reading it now. 

📡 Talk with me about: VR, FPS games, electronic music, functional fashion, what kind of food to bring me to gain my love, cute cats, sci-fi, robots, artificial intelligence, ethics, the ethics of using food to manipulate me, anything Valve, & hardware.

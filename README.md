# Welcome Earthling 🌍, alien 👽, or inter-dimensional entity 🌌

You have arrived at my github. Every moment in your life has brought you here to this very time & place. Truly, tragic. You had so much potential.

## About me

🛸 The being primarily known as Tim: Software engineer & coffee receptacle working @ Activision Blizzard. Currently, I focus on JavaScript & React Native. I'm most well known for my work on the Call of Duty Companion App. The second thing I'm most well known for is my work on theoretical questions such as "what's the second thing I'm most well known for?"

🏭 Abbreviated life recap: Born in the depths of rust-encrusted Detroit. Corrupted by the Starcraft & Age of Empires map editors at a young age. Molded by a teenage addiction to World of Warcraft & The Orange Box. Learned Java from a guru from the literal island of Java. Degree in Computer Science. Crash landed in  California. Wrote a personal github readme - this one - you're reading it now. 

📡 Talk with me about: VR, electronic music, functional fashion, cute cats, what kind of food to bring me to rapidly gain my favor, sci-fi, robots & A.I., ethics, anything Valve, & hardware.

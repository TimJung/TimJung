### Greetings Earthling 🌍, alien 👽, or inter-dimensional entity 🌌. You have arrived at my github.

## About me

🛸 I'm Tim. Software engineer and coffee receptacle working @ Activision Blizzard. I'm most well known for my work on the Call of Duty Companion App. Currently I focus on JavaScript & React Native.

🏭 Born in the depths of rust-encrusted Detroit. Exposed to the Starcraft & Age of Empires map editors at an impressionably young age. Molded by a teenage addiction to World of Warcraft & The Orange Box. Taught Java by a guru from the literal island of Java. Crash landed on the shores of California. 

📡 You should talk to me about VR, electronic music, functional fashion, cute cats, sci-fi, robots & A.I., ethics, anything Valve, & hardware.
